### Hi there 👋 Thanks for visiting my profile page! 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

I'm a software engineer located in Tokyo, Japan. I'm currently looking new opportunities in Japan.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer at Code Chrysalis developing an internal CMS and mentoring other engineers. Before that, I was a QA Engineer at Panasonic Avionics and Bandai Namco Entertainment America. 

Outside of programming, I'm usually playing games 🎲, watching VTubers 📺, or reading light novels 📖.
